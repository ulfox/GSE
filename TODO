# TODO

Scripts
	- Rewrite all scripts to POSIX insdead of bash
	- Remove awk dependency
	- Split the sinit_functions to multiple sinit_{categ}.sh
		- Example: All the sinit_functions that are written for the chroot stage,
			should be moved to a new script: sinit_chroot.sh

End of Script's list

System Builder list
	- Create a Makefile
	- Include ARM build option

End of System's Builder list

Controller list {Initramfs}
	- Support a indirect server-client communication function (See, Server list)
	- Rewrite the cinit_pre-mount.sh script for using only one mount action for the checks
		- Exception to this would be the case of switch flag or of a setup flag.

End of Controller's list

System list
	- Support controller requests on gse user:group, insdead of a standard scp method over ssh.
		- By this, all gpg verifications and hash checks will be generated by the above user:group.
			- Example: The scripts will create a secret key for the gse user and an ssh key,
				therefore all controller requests will be handled by this groupd. This will
				lead to a security boost, since other users will be shielded off from the
				controller.

End of System's List
