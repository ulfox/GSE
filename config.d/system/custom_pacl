# Custom package list
# Include here the packages you want to be emerged.
# Note: You are building a stateless system, which implies that many rootfs areas will be read only. 
# The more complex you make your system, the highest the chance of breaking the setup will be.
#
# Always include packages that require sane write permissions or configure them accordingly to support such a system
# Also remember to update the USEFLAGS from the Portage menu entry and keep in mind that USE flags often conflict!
# Add the full package name and category, otherwise on ebuilds with same name from different categories the process wont be able to proceed.
# Example: foo-category/bar-portage_package
