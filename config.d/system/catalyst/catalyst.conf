# Creates a .CONTENTS file listing the contents of the file. Pick from any of
# the supported options below:
# auto		- strongly recommended
# tar-tv	- does 'tar tvf FILE'
# tar-tvz	- does 'tar tvzf FILE'
# tar-tvy	- does 'tar tvyf FILE'
# isoinfo-l	- does 'isoinfo -l -i FILE'
# isoinfo-f	- does 'isoinfo -f -i FILE'
# 'isoinfo-f' is the only option not chosen by the automatic algorithm.
# If this variable is empty, no .CONTENTS will be generated at all.

# distdir specifies where your distfiles are located. This setting should
# work fine for most default installations.
# 
#It is recommended to keep this related to portdir, however as mentioned
# above, it is not required to do so.

# envscript allows users to set options such as http proxies, MAKEOPTS,

# The envscript file sets environment variables like so:
# export FOO="bar"

# options set different build-time options for catalyst. Some examples are:
# autoresume = Attempt to resume a failed build, clear the autoresume flags with
#	the -a option to the catalyst cmdline.  -p will clear the autoresume flags
#	as well as your pkgcache and kerncache
#	( This option is not fully tested, bug reports welcome )
# bindist = enables the bindist USE flag, please see package specific definition,
#	however, it is suggested to enable this if redistributing builds.
# ccache = enables build time ccache support
# distcc = enable distcc support for building. You have to set distcc_hosts in
# 	your spec file.
# icecream = enables icecream compiler cluster support for building
# kerncache = keeps a tbz2 of your built kernel and modules (useful if your
#	build stops in livecd-stage2)
# pkgcache = keeps a tbz2 of every built package (useful if your build stops
#	prematurely)
# preserve_libs = enables portage to preserve used libs when unmerging packages
#   (used on installcd-stage2 and stage4 targets)
# seedcache = use the build output of a previous target if it exists to speed up
#	the copy
# snapcache = cache the snapshot so that it can be bind-mounted into the chroot.
#	WARNING: moving parts of the portage tree from within fsscript *will* break
#	your cache. The cache is unlinked before any empty or rm processing, though.
#
# (These options can be used together)
#
# If you intend to use often the catalyst option, it is recommended to enable ccache.
# However before doing so, please read about ccash from the gentoo wiki and concider that
# ccashe leads to build fails in some occasions. Most of the time, a clean portage snapshot
# will built without any issue, however a custom portage snapshot, with extra packages or
# with modified useflags, will have an increased chance for failing the process.
#
# Concerning distcc, you should remember to add it as an entry to your spec files, along with
# the related hosts. Example distcc_hosts: 192.168.2.42/10
# It is assumed that host have been pre-configured, but if no, then please referee to distcc at
# Gentoo wiki and in the documentations
options="autoresume bindist kerncache pkgcache seedcache snapcache"

# portdir specifies the source portage tree used by the snapshot target.
# Please provide a normal portage dir. Meaning that, the more you customize
# a portage directory the highest the chance will be for a stage build to fail.
# Always remember to use sane useflags, if you are going for profiles modification
#
# Last, it should be mentioned that the scripts will attempt to make some checks and
# provide some info concerning the portdir target, however those would be basic checks,
# wich means that the process will attempt to proceed without notifying.
portdir="/usr/portage"

# sharedir specifies where all of the catalyst runtime executables are. Most
# users do not need to change this.
sharedir="/usr/lib64/catalyst"

# snapshot_cache specifies where the snapshots will be cached to if snapcache is
# enabled in the options.
# You would probably need to change this too, if you are changing storedir for
# disk space issues.
snapshot_cache="/var/tmp/catalyst/snapshot_cache"

# storedir specifies where catalyst will store everything that it builds, and
# also where it will put its temporary files and caches.
#
# Simply put, all magic happens here, which implies that most space is used here.
#storedir="/var/tmp/catalyst" 


# port_logdir is where all build logs will be kept. This dir will be automatically cleaned
# of all logs over 30 days old. If left undefined the logs will remain in the build directory
# as usual and get cleaned every time a stage build is restarted.
#
# There is no recommended target for this entry, but again keeping everything close to storedir
# will keep things less spread.
port_logdir="/var/tmp/catalyst/tmp"

# var_tmpfs_portage will mount a tmpfs for /var/tmp/portage so building takes place in RAM
# this feature requires a pretty large tmpfs ({open,libre}office needs ~8GB to build)
# WARNING: If you use too much RAM everything will fail horribly and it is not our fault.
# set size of /var/tmp/portage tmpfs in gigabytes
#
# If you have a old pc with less that 12 GB of ram, you should avoid this.
# var_tmpfs_portage=16
