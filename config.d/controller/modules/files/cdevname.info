# This file is will be automatically generated if you choose the guided fstab configuration entry
# However there is a manual entry on the submenu to aid extra needs.
#
# The general syntax of a line is as follows: {LABEL} {device} {size{M,G}/all}
# Example 1 BOOT /dev/sda1 100M will create a partition /dev/sda1 with a fixed size of 100M and LABEL=BOOT
# Example 2 BOOT /dev/sda1 1G will create a partition /dev/sda1 with a fixed size of 1G and LABEL=BOOT
# Example 3 SYS /dev/sdb1 full will create a partition /dev/sdb1 which will take all the available space and LABEL=SYS
# The filesystem type is located at the fstab.info file which is automatically created from the guided fstab entry
# and it can also be configured manually from the same submenu.
