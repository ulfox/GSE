# Custom scripts configuration file
# Please input the path to your script ( absolute path ) to make it start and run once on bootup.
#
# It requires no explanation about the effects of a miss-configured script that runs on bootup.
# So please include scripts that have been checked and must really be included.
#
# For now, this services provides only the features of /etc/local.d
# In the future a new file will be added with guided interface for configuring Initscripts, which for now
# go way beyond the scope of this project.
#
# Syntax: {/path/to/script}
